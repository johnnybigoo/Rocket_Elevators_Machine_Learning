By the 4th week We have created a CRUD website using a using Ruby on Rails with the website created in the Genesis Program.

We have also included a MySql Database that saves the quotations inserted in the quote form, and an Admin page.

For the 5th week, we have included a Data Warehouse with Postgres where has taken the subimitted quotes and contact forms info and through some queries
the Admin was able to analyse those data.
